# Exoplanets Interferometer Simulator

Contains the python files to launch the simulation

This code computes the list of known exoplanets that would be observable with an imaging or interferometric instrument based on assumptions on the wavelength, inner working angle and contrast. It also produces overview plots as shown below.

To launch the code, please locate yourself in the directory containing the 'programme.py' file and use the command :
python -W ignore programme.py

The code being launch you will have to answer several questions concerning the Inner working angle you want to use and your limit of contrast.
